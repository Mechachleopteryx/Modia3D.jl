\section{Example: Billiard Table with 16 Billiard Balls}\label{sec:Examples}

The billiard table, in Fig.~\ref{fig:billiardTable}, has 16 billiard balls and is used as one benchmark for Modia3D.
The material constants are shown in Table~\ref{table:billiardTableMaterials}.
The left most ball has an initial velocity to the right and hits the 15 other balls after a short time interval
exactly at the top of the ball triangle. This results in a symmetric evolution of the balls, as one would expect.
All previously described effects (sliding, rolling, colliding) act together. The hybrid DAE system has $\dim(\bvec{x}) = 13 \cdot 16 = 208$ and there are
about 200 possible collision pairs. Simulation on a standard PC needs about 20~minutes for 5~seconds simulation time. 
At the moment the code is implemented for functionality and not tuned for efficiency, so a speed-up is expected in the future.
