\section{Example: Billiard Table with 16 Billiard Balls}\label{sec:Examples}

The billiard table in Fig.~\ref{fig:billiardTable} has 16 billiard balls.
The material constants are shown in Table~\ref{table:billiardTableMaterials}.
The cue ball has an initial velocity pointing to the right and hits the the center of the rack (15 other balls) exactly after a short time interval. This results in a symmetric evolution of the balls, as one would expect.
All previously described effects (sliding, rolling, colliding) act together. The hybrid DAE system has $\dim(\bvec{x}) = 13 \cdot 16 = 208$ and there are
about $200$ possible collision pairs. Simulation on a standard PC needs about \SI{20}{\minute} for \SI{5}{\second} of simulation time. 
At the moment, the Modia3D code is implemented for functionality and not tuned for efficiency, so a speed-up is expected in the future.
