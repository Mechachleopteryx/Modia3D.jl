\begin{abstract}
Modia3D is an experimental Julia package to model and simulate 3D mechanical systems.
Ideas from modern game engines are used to achieve a highly flexible setup
and features of multi-body algorithms are used to get a rigid mathematical formulation and
support, for example, of closed kinematic loops. Collision handling is performed on convex
geometries with elastic response calculation. 
A Modia3D model is solved with
a variable-step solver. This is important to combine Modia3D with the equation-based modeling system Modia in the future.
